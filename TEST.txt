First we test 'machine learning' but we got wrong results. Then, we used cosine similarity instead of just using tfidf as ranking.
Testing ACM as input, we realized that the tfidf weight should be adjusted by multiplying instead of adding.
Testing master of software engineering, we found important text should be <tilte> instead of <h>.....<title=xxxxx>.
